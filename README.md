- [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/) by Max Kuhn & Julia Silge  
This book is a guide to using a collection of software in the R programming language for model building called **tidymodels**.  

- [STAT 545 - Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](https://stat545.com/) by Jenny Bryan  
This site is about everything that comes up during data analysis **except for statistical modelling and inference**.  

- [NTRES 6100 - Collaborative and Reproducible Data Science in R](https://nt246.github.io/NTRES-6100-data-science/), Cornell University, Spring 2023  
This course introduces a series of practical tools that enable researchers to spend less time wrestling with software or repeating error-prone manual data processing and more time getting research done in efficient and transparent ways that facilitate collaboration and reproducibility.  

- [Exploring, Visualizing, and Modeling Big Data with R](https://okanbulut.github.io/bigdata/) by Okan Bulut & Christopher Desjardins  
Working with BIG DATA requires a particular suite of data analytics tools and advanced techniques, such as machine learning (ML). Many of these tools are readily and freely available in R. This full-day session will provide participants with a hands-on training on how to use data analytics tools and machine learning methods available in R to explore, visualize, and model big data.  

- [UC Business Analytics R Programming Guide](http://uc-r.github.io/) by Bradley Boehmke, University of Cincinnati  

- [Welcome to Statistics Online Support (SOS)](http://sites.utexas.edu/sos/) by The University of Texas at Austin  
Do you want to conduct an inferential test or do you want to provide descriptive statistics?

- [Applied Statistics with R](https://book.stat420.org/) by David Dalpiaz  
This book was originally (and currently) designed for use with STAT 420, Methods of Applied Statistics, at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
