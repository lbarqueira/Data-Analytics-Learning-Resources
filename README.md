This course introduces a series of practical tools that enable researchers to spend less time wrestling with software or repeating error-prone manual data processing and more time getting research done in efficient and transparent ways that facilitate collaboration and reproducibility.  

- [Exploring, Visualizing, and Modeling Big Data with R](https://okanbulut.github.io/bigdata/) by Okan Bulut & Christopher Desjardins  
Working with BIG DATA requires a particular suite of data analytics tools and advanced techniques, such as machine learning (ML). Many of these tools are readily and freely available in R. This full-day session will provide participants with a hands-on training on how to use data analytics tools and machine learning methods available in R to explore, visualize, and model big data.  

- [UC Business Analytics R Programming Guide](http://uc-r.github.io/) by Bradley Boehmke, University of Cincinnati  

- [Welcome to Statistics Online Support (SOS)](http://sites.utexas.edu/sos/) by The University of Texas at Austin

- [Applied Statistics with R](https://book.stat420.org/) by David Dalpiaz  
This book was originally (and currently) designed for use with STAT 420, Methods of Applied Statistics, at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  

- [Data Science in Education Using R](https://datascienceineducation.com/) by Isabella C. Velásquez and others  
In this book, the **six steps** involved in the process of data science from Wickham & Grolemund are used, see [Chapter 3.2 - Defining The Process of Data Science](https://datascienceineducation.com/c03.html#defining-the-process-of-data-science). These are:  
  - Importing data;
